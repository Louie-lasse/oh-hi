# oh-hi
A puzzle type game. The program is currently without GUI, and only 2 out of 3 rules are implemented.
The two implemented rules can create a special case,
where the program doesn't understand that a Cell needs to be
a ceratin color, and might fill it randomly.
This may cause a contradiction, which will trigger a WorldCreationException. This will be fixed
in the next update, before the last rule is implemented.
